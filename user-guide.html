                <h2>System features</h2>
                <p>In this section we will focus on describing the main features of the application, by going through
                    the available pages.</p>
                <h4>Start Page</h4>
                <p>Upon visiting the start page, users are
                    greeted with a clean and intuitive interface designed to facilitate easy navigation through the vast
                    resources and functionalities the platform offers. At the forefront, two buttons serve as
                    gateways to the core features of the system: one leads to a dedicated page for browsing our
                    RDF schema. The second button is
                    tailored for those eager to delve deeper into the data through SPARQL queries, providing direct
                    access to a querying interface where users can execute custom searches to retrieve specific
                    information or explore the data in novel ways. Additionally, for users interested in a comprehensive
                    understanding of the platform, the button placed in the lower right corner of the screen
                    offers immediate access to a scholarly HTML report. This report meticulously details the solution's
                    architecture, features, and benefits.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="start-page.png" alt="start-page" style="width:100%">
                    <figcaption>Fig.1 The start page</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h4>Ontology Browser Page</h4>
                <p>The Ontology Browser page of our system serves as a dynamic gateway into web
                    development concepts encapsulated within our RDF schema. Upon arrival, users are presented with a
                    dropdown menu listing all the main classes defined in the schema, such as programming languages and
                    web technologies. This feature offers a structured starting point for
                    exploration, allowing users to navigate through the hierarchy and delve into individual topics of
                    interest. Selecting a topic unveils a curated display of content related to that subject, including
                    detailed descriptions, tutorials, or examples. Additionally, when available, the page enriches the
                    user's exploration by integrating relevant knowledge from DBpedia. At the
                    bottom of the page, a "Related Content" section further enhances the browsing experience by
                    suggesting information on similar topics, encouraging users to explore the interconnectedness of web
                    development concepts and technologies, thereby fostering a deeper understanding and learning
                    progression.</p>

                    <figcaption>Fig.2 Ontology browser page</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h4>SPARQL Query Page</h4>
                <p>The SPARQL Query page is a powerful tool designed for users who wish to engage directly with the
                    underlying RDF model of our web development content management system. This interactive interface
                    features a text box where users can input and execute their custom SPARQL queries, providing a
                    hands-on approach to data exploration and retrieval. To assist users unfamiliar with SPARQL syntax
                    or those seeking inspiration, the page includes two sample queries as guides: one for fetching all
                    classes defined within our RDF model, offering a broad overview of the schema's structure, and
                    another for retrieving all content related to a specific topic, allowing for targeted exploration of
                    the repository's wealth of web development resources.</p>

                <p>Upon executing a query, the results are initially presented in an easily readable HTML format,
                    catering to users' preferences for quick insights and visual clarity. Recognizing the diverse needs
                    of our user base, the page also features a dropdown menu enabling the selection of JSON as an
                    alternative output format. This flexibility supports users who may require the data in a structured
                    format for further processing, integration with other tools, or simply because they prefer the JSON
                    syntax for its ubiquity in web development and APIs. This feature underscores the system's
                    commitment to accommodating a wide range of user preferences and technical requirements, ensuring
                    that the platform is as inclusive and accessible as possible.</p>
