                <p>The WeD project proposes the creation of a sophisticated multi-device (micro-)service-oriented
                    cloud-based system
                    designed to intelligently model and manage public technical content related to Web development. This
                    encompasses a diverse range of information, including tutorials, source-code
                    examples,
                    news, events, and more, sourced from reputable platforms such as <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/"> MDN Web
                        Docs</a>.
                    The core innovation lies in the application's utilization of <a
                        href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkedData">Linked Data</a> principles,
                    enabling it to generate and expose knowledge of significant interest to Web developers. This
                    knowledge
                    is accessible to both human users and software through a <a
                        href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">SPARQL</a> endpoint.</p>
                <p>The system facilitates granular exploration based on various criteria, including programming
                    language/paradigm, specific framework guides/references, target platform, purpose. Furthermore, the
                    project integrates additional knowledge from
                    <a href="https://www.dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a> and/or <a
                        href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Introduction">Wikidata</a>, enhancing the richness
                    and diversity of information available. The
                    implementation aligns with the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/ccs">ACM Computing Classification
                        System</a>, ensuring comprehensive coverage
                    of
                    topics relevant to the Web development community.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>In the ever-evolving landscape of Web development, the abundance of technical content across
                    different
                    platforms necessitates a more intelligent and efficient approach to modeling and managing this
                    wealth of
                    information. The WeD project addresses this challenge by proposing the development of a multi-device
                    (micro-)service-oriented system that embraces Linked Data principles.</p>
                <p>The system's primary goal is to provide Web developers with a smart and dynamic interface for
                    exploring
                    and discovering public technical content. This content spans various types, from tutorials
                    to source-code examples, news, and events, sourced from leading platforms like
                    MDN Web Docs.</p>
                <p>By incorporating Linked Data principles, WeD enables the generation and exposure of knowledge
                    relevant to
                    Web developers. The system employs a SPARQL endpoint, ensuring accessibility for both human users
                    and
                    software applications. Through a thoughtful implementation, users can navigate this knowledge
                    repository
                    based on specific criteria such as programming language, framework, target platform, purpose,
                    geographical area, period of time, and personalized preferences.</p>

                <h2>Internal Data Structures and Models</h2>
                <p>
                    Designing a robust internal data structure is fundamental to the success of the WeD (Web Developer
                    Companion) project. This section outlines the preliminary considerations for the data structures and
                    models that will underpin the system's architecture, ensuring efficient storage, retrieval, and
                    manipulation of web development content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The internal data model will be based on the Resource Description
                    Framework (RDF) to represent information in a semantic and interconnected manner. RDF provides a
                    flexible and extensible framework for defining entities, relationships, and metadata within the
                    knowledge base.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consideration will be given to defining explicit
                    relationships between entities, ensuring a rich network of connections. This approach enables users
                    to traverse the knowledge base seamlessly and discover related content based on various criteria
                    such as topic, language, and framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The incorporation of ontologies will play a crucial role in structuring
                    concepts within the data model. Ontologies provide a shared vocabulary that enhances the clarity and
                    consistency of information, promoting a standardized understanding of web development content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each entity and resource will be assigned a Unique
                    Resource Identifier (URI) to ensure globally unique identification. URIs enable unambiguous
                    referencing and facilitate interoperability with external datasets, aligning with Linked Data
                    principles.

                <h2>Conformance to Linked Data Principles</h2>
                <p>
                    The WeD (Web Developer Companion) project meticulously adheres to the Linked Data principles,
                    fostering a structured and interconnected knowledge representation. These principles guide the
                    design and implementation of the system, ensuring seamless integration, discoverability, and
                    meaningful relationships within the web of data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each entity and resource within the WeD system is
                    assigned a unique Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). This ensures unambiguous identification and
                    facilitates global accessibility to resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Resource Description Framework (RDF) is employed
                    as the foundational language for representing knowledge in a machine-readable format. This allows
                    for the creation of semantic relationships and enriches the content with meaningful context.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is utilized for
                    data retrieval and interaction within the WeD system. This standardized protocol ensures uniform
                    access to resources and supports the principles of openness and decentralization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    WeD leverages RDF as the standard data
                    model, promoting the creation of links between resources. The SPARQL query language is employed to
                    provide users and applications with a flexible and powerful means of querying and extracting
                    relevant information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The WeD system integrates additional knowledge
                    from external sources such as DBpedia and/or Wikidata. This cross-referencing enhances the richness
                    of information, aligning with the Linked Data principle of connecting to other datasets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project incorporates ontologies to define and organize
                    concepts within the knowledge base. This semantic structuring ensures a shared understanding of data
                    and facilitates more nuanced and accurate queries.

                    public technical content for web development. The core functionalities, such as the application of
                    Linked Data principles and the provision of a SPARQL endpoint for knowledge discovery, have been
                    successfully implemented.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, it is important to note that one of our primary objectives, the aggregation of data from
                    multiple sources, has been partially met. Due to unforeseen challenges in scraping content, we have
                    primarily relied on MDN Web Docs as our sole data source. This limitation has consequently impacted
                    the total volume of data available within the system, falling short of our initial expectations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite these challenges, our solution has considerably satisfied the project's criteria, despite
                    their complexity. The features that have been put into place demonstrate our ability to provide a
                    foundation that supports the objectives of the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The projected outcome is optimistic. We have established a working solution that
                    complies with the expected results, leaving room for future enhancements. With the intention of
                    expanding our data sources, improving our processes, and eventually expanding the utility and reach
                    of our system to better serve the web development community, we remain committed to developing and
                    improving the WeD project.

                    Using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/?nav=min">Azure DevOps </a> and a combination of Bicep templates and Azure YAML pipelines, the project
                    achieves automated deployments, testing, and infrastructure management. This CI/CD setup ensures
                    that updates, features, and fixes are rapidly and reliably deployed across all components of the
                    system, from microservices to the web application, while also facilitating rollback and version
                    control. The extensive use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Bicep allows for reproducible and
                    consistent infrastructure provisioning, reducing the potential for human error and enhancing
                    security and compliance. <b>Idempotence</b>.

                    In writing this SRS, the authors did contribute individually, with
                    each author being assigned specific chapters.
                    Naturally, both authors had to agree on all the chapters and
                    adjustments were made by the time the final version of the SRS was
                    arrived at.
